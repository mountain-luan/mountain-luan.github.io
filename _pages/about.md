I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, advised by Prof. [Xiaoqun Wu](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1303) (Shenzhen University). From Oct. 2024 to Sept. 2025, I was a Visiting Ph.D. student in the Division of Automatic Control at Linköping University, Sweden, hosted by Prof. [Claudio Altafini](https://liu.se/en/employee/claal20). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I obtained my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Anhui University.

My research interests lie in opinion dynamics on complex networks and multi-agent systems. I am particularly interested in the intersection of control theory and data-driven approaches in these fields.
