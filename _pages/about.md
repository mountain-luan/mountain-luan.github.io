I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, advised by Prof. [Xiaoqun Wu](https://maths.szu.edu.cn/info/1016/2422.htm). I also spent a year as a Visiting Ph.D. Student (2024–2025) in the Division of Automatic Control at Linköping University, Sweden, hosted by Prof. [Claudio Altafini](https://liu.se/en/employee/claal20). Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Anhui University, where I was mentored by Prof. [Haifeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VHrlqpgAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Network Science** and **Control Theory**, with a primary focus on **Multi-agent Systems**. Currently, I am dedicated to **Opinion Dynamics**, investigating how complex opinions evolve and collective behaviors (e.g., consensus and polarization) emerge over social networks. Specifically, I integrate **control-theoretic modeling** to uncover the mathematical mechanisms behind these phenomena, combined with **data-driven approaches** to validate sociological hypotheses using real-world interactions. My early research also explored network synchronization, link prediction, and influential spreader identification.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email at [luanyy_1704@whu.edu.cn](mailto:luanyy_1704@whu.edu.cn) (preferred) or [yyluan1999@gmail.com](mailto:yyluan1999@gmail.com).
