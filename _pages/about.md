I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, advised by Prof. [Xiaoqun Wu](https://maths.szu.edu.cn/info/1016/2422.htm). From Oct. 2024 to Sept. 2025, I was a Visiting Ph.D. student in the Division of Automatic Control at Linköping University, Sweden, hosted by Prof. [Claudio Altafini](https://liu.se/en/employee/claal66). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I obtained my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Anhui University, during which I worked with Prof. [Haifeng Zhang]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k3Kmv4QAAAAJ&hl=en](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VHrlqpgAAAAJ&hl=en)).

My research generally lies at the intersection of Control Theory and Network Science. Currently, I primarily focus on **Opinion Dynamics**. This involves modeling how individuals update their beliefs over social networks using *control-theoretic tools*, as well as conducting *data-driven analysis* based on real-world user interactions on social media. Previously, I also worked on network synchronization, link prediction, and influential spreader identification.

If you are interested in my research topics, you are more than welcome to contact me via email at luanyy_1704@whu.edu.cn (preferred) or `yyluan1999@gmail.com`. My office is located at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.
